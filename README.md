Odin Landing Page Project

This is the Landing Page project, part of the Odin Project's Foundations course.  The aim of the project is to construct an entire webpage based on a provided design.  The provided font and color information does not appear to match the design example, but the end result is attractive nonetheless.

Most of the skills required to construct this project have been learned in the Foundations course.  Some design element required independent research.  This project should serve as evidence of the acquisition of basic front-end skills with the following programs and technologies: Command Line Interface (on a Mac), Git, VSCode, Github, HTML, and CSS (Flexbox, in particular).

The project may be updated in the future if the author decides to explore customizing the site beyond the basic design provided by the Odin Project.  For the time being, however, it is complete.
